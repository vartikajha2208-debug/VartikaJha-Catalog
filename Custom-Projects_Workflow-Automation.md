# Custom Projects_Workflow Automation

While my primary expertise lies in executive, virtual, and AI assistance, I also take on **customized projects** that may extend beyond my usual domain.

For example — a client required a **landing web page and product catalog** to be designed and organized from scratch. Though it wasn’t my core area, I took the initiative to learn the necessary tools and, with proper time and resources, **successfully built a functional and engaging web page** that aligned with the client’s vision.

These custom projects reflect my adaptability, structured learning approach, and commitment to delivering results no matter the challenge.
